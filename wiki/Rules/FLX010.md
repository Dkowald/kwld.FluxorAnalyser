Reducer methods must take and return a feature state object.  
And either include a single action object argument, 
or declare the action in ReduceMethodAttribute

```c#
[ReducerMethod(typeof(UpdateName))]
public static SomeState Reduce1(SomeState state) 
  => state with { };

[ReducerMethod()]
public static SomeState Reduce2(SomeState state, UpdateName action)
  => state with { };
```
